Welcome to the `webauthn-rp` docs! Here you'll find an autogenerated reference to
the code as well as tutorials on how to get started with the library. The aim of
this project is to enable Relying Parties to easily use public key credentials
in Python backend web applications. Support is only for Python 3.x considering that 
Python 2.x reached its end of life in early 2020. This allows for the use of many 
features of Python 3 such as built-in type hinting and static type checking with mypy.

You can integrate this library into any backend web framework by implementing an
interface that abstracts the operations that you'll need to perform as a public key
credential registrar (explained in more detail in the "Server Configuration" page).

The general flow diagram for web authentication is shown in the diagrams below (from the spec):

In the case of registration, the Relying Party server must send a challenge along with
information about the user that is to be registered and the specific Relying Party to
which that user is associated. This library is meant to aid in the generation of messages
used in step 1 and the validation performed in step 6. Steps 0 and 5 are typically
handled by an application-specific client library while the routing and parsing operations
of steps 1 and 6 will need to be managed by the application-specific backend although
some utilities are provided. Steps 2, 3, and 4, however, are completely managed by the
browser and authenticator and are not part of this library. In fact, they are
mostly covered by a different specification (the Client To Authenticator Protocol, or CTAP).

Authentication is very much like registration, however some of the message formats are
different and consequently the parsing and validation operations as well. The steps
and how they are handled mirror those of the registration flow.
